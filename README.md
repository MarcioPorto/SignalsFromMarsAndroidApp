# SignalsFromMarsAndroidApp
An app with a simple interactive story that develops based on decisions made by the user (from Treehouse's course at http://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-an-interactive-story-app). Once I am done with [Paroli](https://github.com/MarcioPorto/Paroli), I intend to come back and change this to add my own story.
